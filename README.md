# Machine Learning Daily Projects
In this repository, you'll find a collection of Data Science projects implemented in Python. These projects serve as demonstrations of my self-learning journey in the field.
All the projects are done on Google Colab. The server is running on Python version 3.10.12.

## __Libraries required__

The following libraries are required to successfully implement the projects.

* Python 3.7+
* NumPy (for linear algebra)
* Pandas (for data preprocessing)
* Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
* Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* Seaborn (for statistical data visualization)
